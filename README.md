# Introduction

The VAERS data set documents adverse vaccine reactions in the United States. The data set is compromised of multiple sources of reporting, such as health care providers, vaccine producers, and patients themselves. This data is used to study vaccines and improve their overall quality and reduce the number of adverse reactions in the future.  

## What is the purpose of this guide?

The purpose of this guide is to improve the quality of the VAERS data set by building equality for the opportunity for diverse backgrounds to self-report effectively which in turn helps vaccines and response systems to side effects. We will achieve this objective by discussing the MEDDRA book that discusses symptoms, and include a description of where the reports travel and how the data is used after it has been collected.

## How was this guide produced?

Explain how you compiled this guide in a few sentences. You might also pull from the methods section of your abstract. Feel free to leave out the context of our course. 

## Who should read this guide?

This guide is intended for patients experiencing adverse vaccine reactions that plan on self-reporting their symptoms, and may for any reason feel unsure of how to do so. Patients should expect to find a walk through of the process, including how the data set is used and the implications of their report.

## What is VAERS

In 1986, Congress passed the National Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) which required both the manufacturers of vaccines and health professionals to report adverse events that occured after vaccinations. These reports were sent to the U.S Department of Health and Human Services. 

NCVIA created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VCIP) as compensation for people found to be injured by vaccines that were identified as harmful in the vaccine injury table. VCIP was administered by the Division of Injury Compensation Programs, Healthcare Systems Bureau (HSB), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the U.S Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). People could still receive compensation even if their vaccines were not found to develop injuries if they petitioned. In conclusion you could receive compensation for vaccine-related injuries or petitions.

NCVIA and VCIP formed due to the abundance of lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers and healthcare providers. These lawsuits created potential harm in vaccine shortages and a reduction of vaccination rates, so these two programs were a reactive solution.As a result of these two acts from 1986, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) created VAERS in 1990. 

The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) data set documents adverse reactions to vaccines administered in the United States. It is a collection of information from multiple sources of reporting, such as health care providers, vaccine producers, and patients themselves. This data is important because it provides valuable insights about reactions and side effects people have experienced that could be correlated to their vaccination. It strives to reduce the number and likelihood of adverse reactions in the future. VAERS studies the administration of vaccines to improve the vaccine quality by helping calculate the risk-benefit analysis of vaccines over time. 


## Assess Your Symptoms - When to Report 

The CDC/FDA recommend reporting any ‘clinically important’ symptoms, even if you are unsure of their connection to the vaccination. However, ‘clinically important’ may be unclear. In order to ensure the validity of the data set, we encourage you to reflect on symptoms before reporting. For example, ask yourself “is this stuffy nose a clinically important symptom?” If your symptoms are too mild for you to consider them clinically important, you may decide to refrain from reporting. Please also be sure to report symptoms with the utmost honesty and accuracy. 

How do I report my symptoms in the most accurate and comprehensive manner? You can use the MedDRA Mobile Browser (MMB), an organized standardized medical terminology. The data is sorted in standardized terminology to assist with the analyses. MMB is available on Android and iOS mobile devices which is an easier approach to MedDRA in comparison to the Desktop version. We use MedDRA for the registration, documentation and safety monitoring of medicinal products used by humans. MedDRA can be used before and after a product has been authorized for sales for products of interest to VAERS like vaccines and other medical products. 

Fortunately MedDRA is navigable to the average uer due to the consciousness of its labels and sophistication of the software and analyses. It can analyze independent medical events like “Influenza” or prolonging medical issues such as infections in an organ or system. How and whether either identification is made depends on the hierarchical structure of MedDRA.

The five levels in the MedDRA hierarchy are categorized from detailed to broad. At the most specific level is “Lowest Level Term: Feeling Queasy” which captures 80,000 terms which reflect how observations of a medicinal product might be reported in practice. The second most specific level is “Preferred Term: Nausea” which are single medical concepts for symptoms, signs, diagnosis, investigation, or medical social and family history characteristics. The third level of the hierarchy is the “High Level Term: nausea and vomiting symptoms.” Preferred terms are grouped into this level according to anatomy, physiology, function, etc. The High Level Terms related to each other will link and become High Level Group Terms. Lastly, in the fifth level is the “System Organ Class” which are groupings of aetiology, purpose or manifestation sisters. 

Due to the globalization and worldwide use of MedDRA, health professionals are making strides in creating a better global protection of patient health. MedDRA is constantly growing as medical knowledge increases, and as the need for accessibility expands. For example, in March of 2020 during the spike of COVID-19, MedDRA adopted Brazilian Portuguese translations and then there were 14 languages available which allows for many users to use the tool in their native language. Additionally, with the presence of COVID-19, over 80 medical terms related to COVID-19 were changed or added.

## How to report to VAERS

There are three ways an individual can gain access of the VAERS website and report forms

If an individual wants to report the adverse effects from a vaccine, both the CDC and FDA recommend that individuals put themselves in contact with a healthcare professional. Afterwards, these healthcare professionals will take note of any given patient’s  effects alongside personal information and then fill out a VAERS report. 

If someone would like to self-report, they can go onto google (or any internet search engine) and type “VAERS report.” In most, if not all, the first link will actually be “https://vaers.hhs.gov,” which is the home site for the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting (VAERS).

 After clicking on this link, the homepage for the VAERS report will immediately appear on one’s screen. The top of the homepage for VAERS, will list these five tabs: “about VAERS”, “Report an Adverse Event”, “VAERS data”, “Resources”, and “Submit Follow up information”.  To continue the self-report, one will click on the “report an adverse event” tab, which will take one to a new page that states when a healthcare professional is by law required to report to the Vaers website and when the health care provider are strongly encouraged to report to Vaers.  To continue self-reporting, please scroll down page until you hit the header “ two ways to submit an online report to Vaers: 
 
*Please note, There is a tab at the top of the online report that will automatically translate the website to Spanish.*

Option 1:  submit a Vaers report online. The report must be completed online and submitted in one sitting and cannot be saved and returned to at a later time. Your information will be erased if you are inactive for 20 minutes; you will receive a warning after 15 minutes.

## Institutions Involved
 
Self-reporting patients are the primary source of data, but there are many institutions that influence the production of the dataset.
 
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and branches under the department like the Center of Disease Control (CDC) oversee the data-collection process. As these are government funded institutions, vaccine reporter’s distrust or dislike of the government will have influence over the data. The data collection can be corrupted by political volatility, as people with knowledge of the data set can plant self-reported symptoms that are inaccurate and over-exaggerated as a political statement or protest.
 
The health care industry is involved in the production of the dataset by playing an essential role in notifying(?) vaccine receivers about the dataset. Those with access to affordable health care are more likely to know about the dataset and report their symptoms. This affects the data set by limiting representation from marginalized populations who are less likely to have access to affordable health care.
 
People who do not have access to affordable health care are less likely to know about the VAERS data set because oftentimes, a doctor would suggest that you report your symptoms. If people cannot afford to see a doctor, the less likely to hear about this, and more likely to let their symptoms fade naturally. This affects the data set by limiting representation from marginalized populations who are less likely to have access to affordable health care.
 
The media is another institution that influences the outcome of the dataset. People may become more skeptical of vaccines if the media they are consuming have a negative portrayal of vaccines, and are more likely to report and over exaggerate their symptoms. The dataset would become biased towards a negative extreme, and the validity and reliability would be limited. This can only lead to more vaccine skepticism when the public views this dataset.
 
## Why is this data important?

We identified vaccine producers as primary stakeholders, with a high influence over the outcome of the dataset and also a high interest. Vaccine producers have a high interest in the VAERS dataset as they are influenced by the culture of care for the overall health of the general public, and the dataset is used by them to collect information about adverse side effects, which is crucial for understanding the long-term remote causes of implications of the vaccines that the producers are distributing. With these new innovations from the vaccine producers, the dataset is likely to grow.
Self-Reporting patients are also big stakeholders. They typically have lower interest in the VAERS dataset in the long term, as patients will often remain interested in the near cause of resolving their own symptoms, but less interested in the remote cause of further collection of relevant dataset. This could be due to the fact that many might not be aware of where their data goes and are not actively checking the data set afterwards. However, as the complete dataset is available to the general public and can be accessed through their website, patients could use the dataset to their benefit for identifying trends in vaccine side effects.  


## Important Note about VAERS data

When attempting to draw conclusions from the VAERS data set, it is important to understand the limits that come with this method of data collection. Self-reporting is an important tool for gathering as much information on adverse reactions as possible, but it also has consequences. Self-reported data is naturally biased based on the opinions of the person reporting. VAERS can not eradicate the possibility of reports being made facetiously or with malintent. People who do not believe in the safety of vaccines have the ability to report fake or overexaggerated symptoms, as an attempt to instill fear in VAERS viewers about the vaccines being produced. For example, an anesthesiologist once reported that a vaccine turned him into the Hulk in order to prove the dangers of self-reporting data. 

However, do not let this sway you to distrust VAERS data entirely, either. The most accurate understanding of the VAERS data set recognizes that data is biased and can come from unreliable sources, but due to the large size of the data set, is able to be trusted by vaccine producers and health organizations as a way of monitoring the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines we use today. Whether you end up being right or wrong about your symptoms being connected to the vaccine you received, reporting your symptoms is an extremely helpful tool for the future of vaccine science.
